## About Section
**Body Copy:**
We started Material Lab because we kept meeting founders who were great at their craft but stuck when it came to tech. So we became the team they can call.

We come from tech, design, and business. We know how to build things that look good, work well, and actually get used. And we care enough to treat your product like it's our own.

**Headline:** Good Partners, Good Software

## Capabilities Section (What We Do)

### 1. AUTOMATE with Intelligent Workflows
**Description:** We tuck LLMs and autonomous agents into the tools you already use so the busywork runs itself and your team focuses on the work that needs judgment.
- **Custom Copilots:** Focused assistants for your internal teams (ops, sales, support, finance)
- **RAG Systems:** Instant answers from your own docs, tickets, and data. Not the open internet.
- **Decision Agents:** Automated triage, routing, and if-this-then-that logic across tools
- **End-to-End Ops:** Hands-free execution of the messy workflows that currently live in spreadsheets and inboxes

### 2. BUILD AI-Native Products
**Description:** Go from "I have an idea" to people actually using it. We build web and mobile apps with AI woven into the experience. Not bolted on as a gimmick.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Clickable, usable concepts in days, not months
- **Production Builds:** Architecture that can handle real users, not just demo traffic
- **Deep Integration:** AI shows up where it helps the user, not just where it looks clever
- **Evaluation Loops:** Usage analytics and experiments so adoption doesn't stall after launch

### 3. SCALE with GTM & Revenue Systems
**Description:** Scale your sales engine without scaling headcount. We automate the path from lead to closed-won and make your funnel actually visible.
- **CRM Automation:** Smart routing, follow-ups, and personalization in the CRM you already use
- **RevOps Visibility:** Real-time dashboards that show what's moving the needle (and what's stuck)
- **Sales Engineering:** Automated technical follow-ups, demos, and outreach sequences
- **Growth Experiments:** Ship → Measure → Refine loops baked into your GTM, not tacked on later

### 4. CONVERT with AI-Assisted Web & Brand Systems
**Description:** We build websites and brand systems that actually pull their weight: clear story, clean UX, and content that keeps up as you grow.
- **Strategic Design:** Brand narrative, information architecture, and full-site build in one track
- **Performance:** AI-assisted content and programmatic SEO so pages don't sit empty
- **Optimization:** Layouts and flows designed to increase signups, demos, or whatever "conversion" means for you

## How We Work (The Blueprint)

**1. Talk → Touch**
You tell us the goal and how your team actually works today. We map the workflow, pick the core metric, and prototype in days. No decks. You get a working demo and a clear rollout plan.

**2. Evidence → Ship**
We ship when the metric moves: revenue, hours saved, error rate, conversion. If we can't link a feature to an outcome, we don't build it.

## Why Us (Why Teams Choose Us)
1. **Small team, real partnership:** You work with us directly. No layers, no runaround.
2. **Built for your workflow:** Everything we build fits how your team already operates: tools, rituals, constraints.
3. **Metric-first delivery:** We don't sell features. We solve problems.
4. **Production, not prototypes:** We stay through evaluations, rollout, and reliability so the system is actually used.
5. **AI where it counts:** We use LLMs and agents only where they reduce cost, time, or complexity. Nowhere else.
6. **A tech team for non-technical teams:** Most of our clients are strong in ops or marketing, not engineering. We handle "everything tech" so you can focus on the business.
